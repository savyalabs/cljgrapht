A Clojure graph library that uses [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/). You build
graphs over plain Clojure values, run JGraphT's algorithms, and get plain
Clojure data back.

## Why

Python's `networkx` is slow because it is pure Python. Graph algorithms are
irregular and they chase pointers, so they do not vectorize into a C core as
numpy workloads do. On the JVM the same algorithms run on JIT-compiled code with
real threads.

`loom` and `ubergraph` are pure-Clojure graph libraries. Use one of them if it
covers your needs. `cljgrapht` uses a different approach. It does not write the
algorithms in Clojure. It wraps [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/) and puts a
Clojure API in front of the JGraphT algorithm catalog (shortest paths,
centrality, flow, matching, coloring, isomorphism, and more). Use cljgrapht when
you want an algorithm that the pure-Clojure libraries do not have, or when you
want JGraphT's performance on large graphs. A vertex can be any Clojure value.
Results come back as vectors, sets, and maps.

This is a performance wrapper, not a persistent data structure. Graphs are
JGraphT's native mutable objects. Constructors and mutators return the graph so
that you can thread calls, but they mutate the graph in place.

Requires **JDK 11+** (JGraphT 1.5.x).

### Multigraph edge identity

Graphs created with `:allow-multiple-edges? true` preserve parallel-edge identity
in algorithm results. Path results (`shortest-path`, `astar`, Bellman-Ford,
Yen, Suurballe, all-path, Eulerian, and Chinese-postman variants) include an
`:edges` vector of the selected JGraphT edge objects. Matching and spanning
results include `:edge-objects`, and flow results include `:edge-flow`, keyed by
the actual edge objects. The existing endpoint-based `:edges` and `:flow` values
remain available; for ordinary graphs result shapes are unchanged. Weighted
`add-edge` assigns the weight to the exact newly added edge, so parallel edges
can carry different weights safely. Core edge vectors from `edges`,
`incident-edges`, `incoming-edges`, and `outgoing-edges` retain their existing
shape and carry the edge object as `(:edge (meta edge-vector))`.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[cljgrapht.core :as g]
         '[cljgrapht.algo :as a])

;; Build a weighted directed graph from edge data.
(def road
  (g/weighted-digraph [[:a :b 1.0] [:a :c 4.0] [:b :c 1.0] [:c :d 1.0]]))

;; Cheapest route, as Clojure data.
(a/shortest-path road :a :d)
;; => {:path [:a :b :c :d] :weight 3.0}

;; Undirected social graph; who is most central?
(def social (g/graph [[:alice :bob] [:bob :carol] [:bob :dave] [:carol :dave]]))

(a/betweenness-centrality social)
;; => {:alice 0.0 :bob 2.0 :carol 0.0 :dave 0.0}

;; Dependency graph: order tasks, or detect a cycle.
(def deps (g/digraph [[:compile :test] [:compile :package] [:test :deploy]
                      [:package :deploy]]))

(a/topological-sort deps) ;; => [:compile :test :package :deploy]
(a/cycle? deps)           ;; => false
```

## Loom interop

`cljgrapht.loom` extends [loom](https://github.com/aysylu/loom)'s `Graph`,
`Digraph`, `WeightedGraph`, and `EditableGraph` protocols to raw
`org.jgrapht.Graph`, so loom's generic algorithms (`loom.alg`) run directly on
cljgrapht graphs:

```clojure
(require '[cljgrapht.core :as g]
         '[cljgrapht.loom]  ;; load the protocol extensions
         '[loom.alg :as alg])

(def gr (g/weighted-digraph [[:a :b 1.0] [:a :c 10.0] [:b :c 1.0]]))
(alg/dijkstra-path gr :a :c) ;; => (:a :b :c)
```

Loom is not a dependency of cljgrapht. Add a loom artifact
(`net.clojars.savya/loom` or `aysylu/loom`) to your own deps before you require
`cljgrapht.loom`. Loom's `EditableGraph` operations mutate the underlying
JGraphT graph in place and return the same instance. Loom's persistent graph
records behave differently.

## Performance

These benchmarks use random weighted digraphs and
[criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium) `quick-bench`. They use
Clojure 1.12.5 and JDK 17. They exclude graph construction from the algorithm
rows. Source: [`bench/bench.clj`](bench/bench.clj).

**2,000 vertices / ~10k edges**

| Task | loom 1.0.2 | ubergraph 0.9.0 | cljgrapht |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build from edge list | 201 ms | 27 ms | 4.7 ms |
| Weighted shortest path (Dijkstra) | 7.3 ms | 5.2 ms | 0.27 ms |
| Connected components | 6.0 ms | 22 ms | 1.9 ms |

**10,000 vertices / ~50k edges**

| Task | loom 1.0.2 | ubergraph 0.9.0 | cljgrapht |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build from edge list | 963 ms | 182 ms | 27 ms |
| Weighted shortest path (Dijkstra) | 20 ms | 8.1 ms | 1.1 ms |
| Connected components | 28 ms | 95 ms | 13 ms |

This is the tradeoff of a native Java engine. loom and ubergraph use persistent,
immutable graphs. cljgrapht uses mutable graphs instead. Use cljgrapht when
graph size or algorithm depth is the constraint.
