All notable changes to this project are documented here. This change log follows
the conventions of [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.2] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Bump the optional `net.clojars.savya/loom` dependency to 1.4.2.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- `loom/add-edges*` and `loom/transpose` kept only one weight per vertex pair on
  multigraphs. Weights are now set on the edge object, so parallel edges keep
  their own weight. `loom/transpose` also mirrors the source graph's multiple
  edge and self loop settings instead of dropping parallel edges.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Standardize structured validation for core vertex/edge access, shortest-path
  and flow source/sink arguments, directed algorithm preconditions, and selected
  generator ranges. JGraphT operation failures now retain their original cause.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Edge betweenness centrality, modularity clustering and modularity scoring.
- Adamic-Adar and Leicht-Holme-Newman link prediction.
- BFS and many-to-many Dijkstra shortest paths, plus Eppstein k-shortest paths.
- TSPLIB problem and tour import, and 2D graph layout coordinate helpers.
- Structured validation for core shortest-path and Yen path options, with
  generated and adversarial graph coverage.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Preserve JGraphT edge objects for parallel edges in path results (`shortest-path`,
  `astar`, Bellman-Ford, Yen, Suurballe, all-path, Eulerian, and Chinese-postman
  variants) via additive `:edges`; matching and spanning results via additive
  `:edge-objects`; and max-flow/min-cost-flow results via additive `:edge-flow`.
  Existing endpoint-based fields remain unchanged.
- Assign weights in `core/add-edge` to the exact edge returned by JGraphT, so
  weighted parallel edges do not overwrite one another.
- Core edge-vector results (`edges`, `incident-edges`, `incoming-edges`, and
  `outgoing-edges`) retain their shape and carry the edge object in metadata.

All affected return additions are semver-minor and conditional on multigraph
results; no existing simple-graph return shape changes, so no major bump is
required.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- `density` counts distinct non-loop endpoint pairs, so it no longer exceeds
  1.0 on the multigraph/pseudograph types the public constructor allows.
- `build` guards against `addEdge` returning nil for a rejected duplicate or
  self-loop before calling `setEdgeWeight`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-01

### Changed
- Declare Loom in the pom as an optional dependency so cljdoc can analyze the optional integration namespace. It remains non-transitive for consumers.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Link prediction algorithms and batch link scoring.
- Lowest common ancestor algorithms with naive and rooted implementations.
- Approximate weighted Steiner tree calculation.
- Line graph conversion with optional edge weighting.
- Goldberg maximum-density subgraph calculation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- Full 1-to-1 API parity with JGraphT 1.5.3. All additions are backward compatible.
- **core**: complete `org.jgrapht.Graph` interface — `remove-vertex`, `remove-edge`, `contains-vertex?`, `contains-edge?`, `degree`/`in-degree`/`out-degree`, `incident-edges`/`incoming-edges`/`outgoing-edges`, `edge-source`/`edge-target`/`endpoints`, `get-edge`/`all-edges`, `set-weight`, `order`, `size`, public `directed?`/`weighted?`, and `graph-type` introspection. A configurable `make-graph` constructor (multigraph/pseudograph, self-loop policy, custom vertex/edge suppliers). Six graph views: `unmodifiable-view`, `unweighted-view`, `undirected-view`, `edge-reversed-view`, `weighted-view`, `subgraph`.
- **gen**: every generator in `org.jgrapht.generate` (complete/bipartite, linear, wheel, hypercube, empty, generalized Petersen, windmill, complement, Gnm/Gnp random and bipartite, Barabasi-Albert forest, Kleinberg small-world, scale-free, random-regular, Prüfer tree, planted partition, directed scale-free, linearized chord diagram, weighted matrix) plus the full `NamedGraphGenerator` catalog (44 named graphs) via keyword dispatch.
- **algo**: every algorithm family in `org.jgrapht.alg` — shortest-path variants (bidirectional/delta-stepping/contraction-hierarchy/Yen/Suurballe/all-directed-paths/transitive reduction+closure), cycle enumeration variants + cycle basis + Eulerian + Chinese postman, matching variants + assignment, max-flow variants + min-cost flow + Gomory-Hu + global and s-t min cut, coloring variants, clique/chordal algorithms, vertex cover (exact + 2-approx), independent set, TSP (exact + heuristics), centrality/scoring, clustering, graph measures (diameter/radius/center/periphery/eccentricity/girth), connectivity/blocks/articulation points/bridges/biconnectivity/condensation, isomorphism variants + tree edit distance, planarity + Kuratowski subdivision, and Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition.
- **io**: import/export parity with `org.jgrapht.nio` — GraphML import (export already present), GML, JSON, CSV, DIMACS, graph6/sparse6, matrix export, GEXF, Visio export, and Lemon export, with weighted round-trips and vertex-attribute support.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- Loom is now an optional dependency, moved out of the runtime `:deps` (consumers using the Loom interop must depend on loom themselves, as the README already documents).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- Migrate the build to deps.edn and tools.build, with Leiningen supported via lein-tools-deps.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- `cljgrapht.gen` graph generators for complete, ring, star, grid,
  Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz graphs.
- `cljgrapht.io` DOT and GraphML export helpers, DOT import, and file writers.
- cljdoc migration guide for moving from Loom to cljgrapht.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Shortest-path algorithms in `cljgrapht.algo`: `astar`, `bellman-ford`,
  `bellman-ford-distances`, `johnson-all-pairs`, and `k-shortest-paths`.
- Directed path and cycle enumeration: `all-simple-paths` and `simple-cycles`.
- Graph predicates and measures: `dag?`, `connected?`,
  `strongly-connected?`, `density`, `isolated-vertices`, and `isomorphic?`.
- Undirected clique and scoring algorithms: `maximal-cliques`,
  `clustering-coefficient`, `global-clustering-coefficient`, and `coreness`.
- Bipartite helpers: `bipartite?` and `bipartite-sets`.
- Traversal helpers: `bfs` and `dfs`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Matching algorithms in `cljgrapht.algo`: `maximum-matching` (Edmonds),
  `maximum-weight-matching` (Kolmogorov blossom V), `bipartite-matching`
  (Hopcroft-Karp).
- Flow algorithms: `max-flow` and `min-cut` (push-relabel; edge weights are
  capacities).
- Vertex coloring: `coloring` (DSatur default, `:greedy`,
  `:largest-degree-first`, `:smallest-degree-last` selectable via
  `:algorithm`) and `greedy-coloring`.
- `cljgrapht.loom` - optional loom protocol interop: extends loom's `Graph`,
  `Digraph`, `WeightedGraph`, and `EditableGraph` to raw `org.jgrapht.Graph`
  so `loom.alg` runs directly on cljgrapht graphs. Loom stays out of
  cljgrapht's dependencies; bring your own loom artifact.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Standardize README structure and badges (docs only).

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- README "Performance" section benchmarking cljgrapht against loom and ubergraph,
  plus a reproducible `bench/` harness (criterium).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- Correct the copyright attribution in the README to "Savyasachi". Docs only.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- Reword the README "Why" section to describe cljgrapht by its capabilities and
  credit loom/ubergraph, rather than disparaging them. Docs only; no code change.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

Initial release: an idiomatic Clojure graph library backed by JGraphT 1.5.3.

### Added
- `cljgrapht.core`: graph constructors (`graph`, `digraph`, `weighted-graph`,
  `weighted-digraph`) over Clojure-value vertices, mutators (`add-vertex`,
  `add-edge`), and accessors (`vertices`, `edges`, `neighbors`, `successors`,
  `predecessors`, `weight`).
- `cljgrapht.algo`: `shortest-path`, `shortest-path-length`,
  `all-pairs-shortest-path-length`, `connected-components`,
  `strongly-connected-components`, `topological-sort`, `cycle?`,
  `vertices-on-cycles`, `minimum-spanning-tree`, `betweenness-centrality`,
  `closeness-centrality`, `pagerank`.
- Reflection-clean; CI across JDK 11/17/21 and Clojure 1.10/1.11/1.12.
